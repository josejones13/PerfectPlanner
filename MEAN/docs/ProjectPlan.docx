# **Project Description**

## **Project Overview**
PerfectPlanner is a simple and functional web application that helps users stay organized by allowing them to easily plan and track events. The application gives users the ability to create, view, edit, and delete events in one place. Each event includes details such as the event name, type, date, time, location, and description.  
This first release focuses on building a solid foundation for full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and presenting a clean, user-friendly interface.

## **Purpose and Features**
PerfectPlanner is designed to support individuals or small teams in managing their schedules more efficiently. The landing page provides an easy-to-navigate dashboard with the team logo, site name, and buttons for creating and viewing events. Users can manage all events directly from this dashboard using CRUD operations, ensuring that all event information is organized and accessible.

## **Technology Used**
The web application uses a combined backend and frontend approach.  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, EJS, MongoDB  
- **Frontend:** EJS templates and custom CSS for a clean, user-friendly layout  
- **Deployment:** Cloud service provider such as Render  
All team members contribute through ongoing commits to the public GitHub repository to ensure proper collaboration and version control.
