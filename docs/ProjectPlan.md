## Project Description

### Project Overview
PerfectPlanner is a simple and functional web application that helps users maintain their event organization with easy event planning and tracking, done efficiently. The application would be great for users because it will allow them to create, view, edit, and delete events in an easy and organized manner. Each event will clearly state the event name, type, date, time, location and description all in one place. The web application will focus on providing a working foundation for full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and a clear, user-friendly interface.

This first release focuses on building a solid foundation for full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and presenting a clean, user-friendly interface.

### Purpose and Features
PerfectPlanner is designed to make event organization easier for individuals or small groups by providing a clear event plan and tracker tool. The application offers a dashboard-style landing page featuring the team logo, site name, and buttons to create or view events. Users can manage their events by performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations directly from the dashboard, ensuring all event information is accessible and easy to maintain.

### Technology Used
The web application uses a combined backend and frontend approach:  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, EJS, MongoDB  
- **Frontend:** EJS templates and custom CSS for a clean, user-friendly layout  
- **Deployment:** Cloud service provider such as Render  

All team members contribute through ongoing commits to the public GitHub repository to ensure proper collaboration and version control.
